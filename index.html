            <p> Hi! My name is Alma. I am from Sinaloa Mexico, currently I am an student in BYU Idaho through BYU World Wide. 
                I am studying software development and I am excited to learn a lot about that. I have some hobbies. I like to read, bake, watch tv
                and listen music. I am happy to start this new fase in my life. I will tell you a little more about me. I am married and have two 
                beatiful children, I love spend time with them. Some times when I have free time I like to bake some delicious desserts for my family.
                I have a youtube channel where I share some delicious recipes, it is "ailed recetas y detalles". I created it when we stayed at home during
                the pandemic. I am member of the church since 1998, I was baptized when I was 14 and I think that it has been one of the best desitions that 
                I have taken in my life. Thats it, now here I am in this new journey!
